## Discussion

Points to discuss \[from Arpit\]

* Playground mono
* Let’s use the word DiceDB and not Dice, every where, there are variable and config places where the word Dice is used
* The config “REQUEST\_LIMIT” should be “REQUEST\_LIMIT\_PER\_MIN”
* The config “REQUEST\_WINDOW” should be “REQUEST\_WINDOW\_SEC”
* What is the purpose of the package internals/cmds?
* Why is there a package called db that just is a wrapper over DiceDB commands? Supporting a new command in Playground now means making a change in both backend and frontend. Also, these functions are essentially useless now.
* Also, A better way would be for SDK to expose a generic command that takes command and argos and executes the. What do you think?
* With this, the need for diced.go vanishes
* Instead of exposing the endpoint as \`/cli\`, let’s call it \`/shell/exec\`
* We need all errors to be standardized w.r.t casing. I propose everything to be lowercase.
* server/httpServer.go \-\> server/http.go, why again the word “server”
* “errorResponse” function should do JSON marshal and not string format
* I see places where log and slog both being used, let’s just use slog everywhere
* Need to understand pkg/util/helpers.go, neither the name not the function made much sense.
* Playground Web
* Have a .env file that can take playground mono URL which points to API URL
* Do not call it \`CLI\_COMMAND\_URL\`, a bad name. Call it \`PLAYGROUND\_MONO\_URL\`
* Should we not check in package-lock.json? When I installed the file, it got modified
* README lacks node version requirement
* Does this output static site or does it require a server to run? I see the command \`npm run start\` to start the server in production. Ideally, we want a static website for the playground web. No servers.
* Why is Dockerfile\_Backend file even present in web? Also, very bad name. We are calling it Playground Mono. Also, the name is neither snake nor camel case.
* “CLI” is a bad name, let’s call it Shell.
* “ // comment this to hide footer” is such a useless comment.
* Comments are supposed to be \`// comment\` and not \`//comment\`
* “DiceDB PlayGround” as name should be “DiceDB Logo” “Playground”
* “Cleanup in :” and “Command left:” have inconsistent styling. Also, it should be \`Commands left\`. Add a tool tip (i) button, next to both that tells what these limits are all about.
* Move commands from command.ts file to using DiceDB commands command
* Delete mock data file
* In api.ts, propagate the error to the use instead of just logging it to console. Show user the error that was emitted from the backend/mono.
* Constants file may not be required rightnow, given we should use Playground Mono URL from .env
* Instead of calling “blacklist” let’s use the word “blocklist”
* Why cliUtils has get and set and delete, do we not support any other command? Also, given this file is present in utils folder it should be called \`utils/cli.ts\` and not \`utils/cliUtils.ts\`

## Aug 19, 2024 Store optimization call

Discussed:

Separation of Concerns:

* Commands like MGET/MSET \- Key used across shards,
* Similar for Qwatch \- when we are watching a pattern, the pattern can exist across multiple shards.
* Transactional commands like MGET/MSET \- We need an abstraction layer outside shards that can manage the transaction across teh shards.

IOLayer \- Should it wait for all shards to complete the tasks, proceed only after all shards have responded.

Keep store dumb. All ops on store as atomic as possible.  
. Add complexity to IOLayer / Coordinator in future if optimisation are needed in future.

Next step task \- Remove locks and provide atomic operations.  
\-Address review comments and merge Store abstraction refactor [Yash Sharma](mailto:yash360@gmail.com)  
\- Watch to move out of store / Or implement a scan operator in store [Jyotinder Singh](mailto:jyotindrsingh@gmail.com)  
\- Limit Store operations to Put / Get / Delete & Scan   [Pratik pandey](mailto:pratik.pandey2111@gmail.com)  
\- We are using unsafe pointer, should we move to empty struct ot interface. **Move to generics**.Ashwin Kulkarni  
\- Removing all Mutex from Store after the shards and channels are created for multi threads.- [soumya panigrahi](mailto:soumyapanigrahi@gmail.com)  
\- Skeleton for multithreaded mode [Yash Sharma](mailto:yash360@gmail.com)  
\- Extract Coordinator from IO Tasks. [Gaurav Sarma](mailto:gauravsarma1992@gmail.com)  
\- Qwatch: each io thread launches a qwatch command, this fans out to every shard. Each shard now maintains records for which io threads are listening to which queries . [Jyotinder Singh](mailto:jyotindrsingh@gmail.com)  cc- [soumyapanigrahi@gmail.com](mailto:soumyapanigrahi@gmail.com)  
\- moar thoughts \- the watchlist can be maintained at the said coordinator level  
\- Fanout commands that require consistency  [soumya panigrahi](mailto:soumyapanigrahi@gmail.com) cc- [Jyotinder Singh](mailto:jyotindrsingh@gmail.com)

# Jul 18, 2024

Agenda:

* First community call 🎉
* The documentation website is up: [https://dicedb-docs.netlify.app/](https://dicedb-docs.netlify.app/)
* Plan to keep DiceDB a drop-in replacement of Redis, however, redis feature-set completion won’t be a blocker for launch.
* Aim to support a basic, foundational feature set
* Plans for real-time reactivity:
* Support for JSON
* Filtering on JSON fields
* Optimizations for DSQL query executor:
* Instead of re.match use a specific regex matcher for better performance.
